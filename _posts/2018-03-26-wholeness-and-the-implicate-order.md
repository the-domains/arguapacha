# **Wholeness and the Implicate Order**

David Bohm shows an interesting view of the way the universe interacts, merging his studies on theoretical physics and Eastern philosophy.

The main concept circles around the unity of the universe, similar to the concept of Tao in Taoism, where basically everything is connected in some way, and any attempt to understand this unity would be pointless, as it is impossible to completely comprehend something by understanding their individual parts.

Bohm, however goes exactly in this direction, explaining a view where two kinds of reality complement each other to form this unity.

The explicate order, which concerns everything related to what normally is considered real and conceptually clear out defined, i.e. everything we can study and analyse.

The implicate order seems to be, on the other hand, the stuff we can't comprehend, but serves the purpose of uniting all the concepts found in the explicate order.

To this wholeness, which Bohm calls holomovement, gives us the ability to feel more than being just the sum of individual parts, and keeps the universe united.

As an ever-amateur Taoist, it is a great pleasure to read about the view of a great scientist who took interest in philosophy, and Eastern philosophy for that matter.

There are many concepts in Bohm's viewpoint that I think are worth a dutiful read.
