# Read-me Driven Blogging

A guide to my future self on blogging

---

## Introduction

A few years ago I was reading a book about startups, which I am going to review a bit later. In it, there was an [article][0] that caught my attention. It is a neat analysis on how software could be written, and I think it was great, so I decided to take the concept to my senseless blog.

## Why

First and foremost because I like writing, and reading in general. I don't do it often, however, and I want to change that. Adding a blog to my life hopefully will keep me busy and distracted enough to keep me sane.

## What

My main website is basically aimed to be my portfolio but wanted to keep a separate site for my opinions and random interest. I have my own telegram board to keep track of my really random stuff, but hopefully, I can integrate it with this site when, if, I find the time to write some integration code to it.

Other than the random stuff I find amusing, I will try to post periodically about technical and non-technical topics. Some of the technical posts might end up on my main page too.
